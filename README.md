# Automotive and Pollution Data Worldwide
### ----------
## KCS - github.com/kauecano

Hello world,

This is my first Qlik Sense app. It's intended to be an extension on Woodward's "Automotive.qvf" passed on as support material in his tutorial.

My main focus was to standardize the data dashboards and overviews in a more comprehensive and less limited way, gradually bringing the car-to-pollution connection together. With a more reliable template, sheet scalability is quicker and that's the keyword: quick (not qlik--bad pun).

This project was entirely built in a weekend, so I certainly wasn't able to develop this as much as I could. More throughout analysis, smoother table manipulations and a more polished front end would be my first picks in what this QVD lacked. Basically, I ran short on the more holistic, theoretical and statistical side of Data Science so I could figure out the technical part of QS development and workflow.

Still, this was a great learning activity. I managed to add new data to Woodward's scope, relate it accordingly, display it in a more intuitive way and, of course, integrate it all to a hub navigation system.

I'm also including various other OS projects, extensions and further Qlik Sense related tools in this repo for easier workflow.

Thanks for sticking around!
