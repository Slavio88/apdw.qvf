The Visualization Extension ***sense-navigation*** for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to navigate in your app:

* Go to the next sheet
* Go to the previous sheet
* Go to a specific sheet
* Go to a sheet (defined by the sheet Id)
* Go to a story
* Open a website

The button can be easily styled nicely by selecting some of the predefined designs.

* Lock field
* Unlock all selections
