* Allow to add **additional styles for the button** (very similar to [sense-themable-kpi-tile](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-themable-kpi-tile))
* Allow templates for buttons ([see here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/issues/14))
* **Additional actions**, e.g.
	* Reload the app
	* Opening another app and pass the current selections to the app (similar to "document chaining in QlikView")
* Allow icons instead of images ([see here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/issues/37))
* Select fields instead of defining fields in the expression editor ([see here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/issues/25))
	
Is there **anything else you'd like to see** in this visualization extension?
