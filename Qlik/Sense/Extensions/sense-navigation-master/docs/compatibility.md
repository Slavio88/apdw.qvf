**sense-navigation** is designed to work with Qlik Sense 2.1.1 or higher.
If you use the extension in an older version of Qlik Sense some functionality (like navigating to another sheet, etc.) will simply not work because the [Capability APIs](https://help.qlik.com/sense/2.1/en-US/developer/Subsystems/APIs/Content/mashup-api-reference.htm) used in this extension are not available in earlier versions.
